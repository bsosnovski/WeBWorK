# The following wasw modified in the custom section from the original in the file
# to custom the section and recitation of the user in WeBWorK
# It takes the name of the course in Blackboard (as orignally created) and add the course 

$LTI_modify_user = sub {
  # The self object from LTIAdvanced.pm
  my $self = shift;
  # The user object to be modified
  my $user = shift;

  # Parse context_id for additional information.  E.G.
  my $r = $self ->{r};
  my @course_id=split /\s/, $r->param("context_title");

Note:
Initially, I was not able to authenticate a user in WeBWorK via Blackboard because Blackboard was not sending the info that identifies the user. Thanks to Mike Cage pointing it out, 
I asked Krafins Valcin(CUNY Central and the LTI changed from transfering the data over SSL to transfering data
over any connection.
