# The following was modified in the custom section from the original code in the file
# to customize the section and recitation info of the user in WeBWorK
# It takes the name of the course in Blackboard (as orignally created) and add field course in WeBWorK 

$LTI_modify_user = sub {
  # The self object from LTIAdvanced.pm
  my $self = shift;
  # The user object to be modified
  my $user = shift;

  # Parse context_id for additional information. 
  my $r = $self ->{r};
  my @course_id=split /\s/, $r->param("context_title");
  $user->{"section"} = $course_id[-5].' '.$course_id[-4].' '.$course_id[-3]; #customized to QCC info
  $user->{"recitation"} = $course_id[0].' '.$course_id[1];


Note:
Initially, I was not able to authenticate a user in WeBWorK via Blackboard because Blackboard was not sending the info that identifies the user. Thanks to Mike Cage pointing it out, 
I asked Krafins Valcin (CUNY Central) and he changed the settings from transfering the data over SSL to transfering data
over any connection.
