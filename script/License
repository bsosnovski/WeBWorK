This repository contains a script to convert CUNYFirst rosters to WeBWorK classlists.  
You can share this program with anyone you fell could benefit from it.

The program is unofficial, free and created for educational purposes. 
The program WWClasslist is released under GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (GNU AGPLv3).

Use this program at your own risk. Though, run tests were performed and Iâ€™ve used for my classes without any issue, it  is not guaranteed to always work. 

If you would like to contribute to improve the code, send feedback and corrections to bsosnovski@qcc.cuny.edu.
