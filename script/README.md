# WeBWorK Classlist Program

 This is a script that takes a list of students from CUNYFirst MyInfo and produces a classlist file
 which can be used to import many students into WeBWorK quickly.

 INSTRUCTIONS
 From CUNYFirst MyInfo download the class roster of students to be added to WeBWorK.
 A CSV file with ID, Last Name, First Name and Emails of students is
 created and saved in the destination of your choice.
 Enter the required information about your course as prompted by the program.
 After the program converts the file, upload the LST file to WeBWork in the File Manager.
 From the Classlist Editor, import users from the file uploaded
 
 The students' username is formed by the first letter of first name, 
 followed by the last name and the last two digits of their CUNY ID.
 Their password is their CUNY IDs.
