# WeBWorK
Repository for QCC-CUNY WeBWorK

This repository contains a script to convert CUNYFirst rosters to WeBWorK classlists and other documents to support faculty use of WeBWorK.  You can share these contents with anyone you fell could benefit from them.

The script and documents are unofficial, free and created for teaching purposes. 

Use the program at your own risk. Although tests were performed and Iâ€™ve used it without any issue to create accounts for my students, I can't guarantee that it always works. 

If you would like to contribute to improve the code or documentation(s), please send feedback and corrections to bsosnovski@qcc.cuny.edu.
